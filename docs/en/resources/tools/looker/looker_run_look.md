## About

The `looker-run-look` tool runs the query associated with a
saved Look.

It's compatible with the following sources:

- [looker](../../sources/looker/)

`looker-run-look` takes one parameter, the `look_id`.

## Example

```yaml
tools:
    run_look:
        kind: looker-run-look
        source: looker-source
        description: |
          run_look Tool

          This tool runs the query associated with a look and returns
          the data in a JSON structure. It accepts the look_id as the
          parameter.
```
