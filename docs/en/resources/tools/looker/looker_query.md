## About

The `looker-query` tool runs a query using the Looker
semantic model.

It's compatible with the following sources:

- [looker](../../sources/looker/)

`looker-query` takes eight parameters:

1. the `model`
2. the `explore`
3. the `fields` list
4. an optional set of `filters`
5. an optional set of `pivots`
6. an optional set of `sorts`
7. an optional `limit`
8. an optional `tz`

## Example

```yaml
tools:
    query:
        kind: looker-query
        source: looker-source
        description: |
          Query Tool

          This tool is used to run a query against the LookML model. The
          model, explore, and fields list must be specified. Pivots,
          filters and sorts are optional.

          The model can be found from the get_models tool. The explore
          can be found from the get_explores tool passing in the model.
          The fields can be found from the get_dimensions, get_measures,
          get_filters, and get_parameters tools, passing in the model
          and the explore.

          Provide a model_id and explore_name, then a list
          of fields. Optionally a list of pivots can be provided.
          The pivots must also be included in the fields list.

          Filters are provided as a map of {"field.id": "condition",
          "field.id2": "condition2", ...}. Do not put the field.id in
          quotes. Filter expressions can be found at
          https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/filter-expressions.

          Sorts can be specified like [ "field.id desc 0" ].

          An optional row limit can be added. If not provided the limit
          will default to 500. "-1" can be specified for unlimited.

          An optional query timezone can be added. The query_timezone to
          will default to that of the workstation where this MCP server
          is running, or Etc/UTC if that can't be determined. Not all
          models support custom timezones.

          The result of the query tool is JSON
```
