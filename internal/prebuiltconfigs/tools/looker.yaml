    query:
        kind: looker-query
        source: looker-source
        description: |
          Query Tool

          This tool is used to run a query against the LookML model. The
          model, explore, and fields list must be specified. Pivots,
          filters and sorts are optional.

          The model can be found from the get_models tool. The explore
          can be found from the get_explores tool passing in the model.
          The fields can be found from the get_dimensions, get_measures,
          get_filters, and get_parameters tools, passing in the model
          and the explore.

          Provide a model_id and explore_name, then a list
          of fields. Optionally a list of pivots can be provided.
          The pivots must also be included in the fields list.

          Filters are provided as a map of {"field.id": "condition",
          "field.id2": "condition2", ...}. Do not put the field.id in
          quotes. Filter expressions can be found at
          https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/filter-expressions.

          Sorts can be specified like [ "field.id desc 0" ].

          An optional row limit can be added. If not provided the limit
          will default to 500. "-1" can be specified for unlimited.

          An optional query timezone can be added. The query_timezone to
          will default to that of the workstation where this MCP server
          is running, or Etc/UTC if that can't be determined. Not all
          models support custom timezones.

          The result of the query tool is JSON

    query_sql:
        kind: looker-query-sql
        source: looker-source
        description: |
          Query SQL Tool

          This tool is used to generate the SQL that Looker would
          run against the underlying database. The parameters are
          the same as the query tool.

          The result of the query sql tool is SQL text.

    query_url:
        kind: looker-query-url
        source: looker-source
        description: |
          Query URL Tool

          This tool is used to generate the URL of a query in Looker.
          The user can then explore the query further inside Looker.
          The tool also returns the query_id and slug. The parameters
          are the same as the query tool.

          The result is a JSON object with the id, slug, the url, and
          the long_url.

    get_looks:
        kind: looker-get-looks
        source: looker-source
        description: |
          get_looks Tool

          This tool is used to search for saved looks in a Looker instance.
          String search params use case-insensitive matching. String search
          params can contain % and '_' as SQL LIKE pattern match wildcard
          expressions. example="dan%" will match "danger" and "Danzig" but
          not "David" example="D_m%" will match "Damage" and "dump".

          Most search params can accept "IS NULL" and "NOT NULL" as special
          expressions to match or exclude (respectively) rows where the
          column is null.

          The limit and offset are used to paginate the results.

          The result of the get_looks tool is a list of json objects.

    run_look:
        kind: looker-run-look
        source: looker-source
        description: |
          run_look Tool

          This tool runs the query associated with a look and returns
          the data in a JSON structure. It accepts the look_id as the
          parameter.
